<u>To make a husband faithful.</u><br>
Take the marrow from the left leg of a wolf, and with it fill a case of St. Lucia wood.  Wrap the case with a piece of velvet, and carry it with you.  If you are reasonable and not too demanding, your husband will love no one but you.

<u>Secret for traveling twenty miles an hour.</u><br>
Take two ounces of human fat, one ounce of oil of nerves, one ounce of oil of laurel, one ounce of deer fat, and an ounce of natural mummy, with two glasses of wine spirits, and seven verbena leaves.  Bring it all to a boil in a small new earthen pot, until it is reduced to half the volume.  Then spread the ointment over a new handkerchief, and when you apply it to the spleen area, you will go like the wind.  In order not to become ill after traveling, bathe your feet in white wine.

<u>A secret to win a fortune in games where numbers are foretold.</u><br>
cut with a scissor small slips of paper, on each of which you should write a number;  you can make as many numbers as you wish.  put all these slips in a large box, such that the numbers are facing down.  take a spider, first trap it in a glass bottle for half an hour, then smash it with the magic wand, saying, "<i>Mihi prosint numera per Dominum Deum nostrum!</i>"  The spider will curl up and pretend to be dead, but it will not be.  Grab it, sprinkle it with holy water, and trap it in the box, wher it must remain one entire night.  whereupon, opening the box, you will observer the little slips of paper have turned, and those nubmers will be the good ones, and they will have luck at games.
