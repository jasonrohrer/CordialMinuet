CORDIAL MINUET $3000 SERVER HACKING CHALLENGE
---------------------------------------------


The server is at:

cordialminuet.com


The game server runs at:

http://cordialminuet.com/gameServer/
http://cordialminuet.com/gameServer/server.php


The complete source code is here:

http://sourceforge.net/p/hcsoftware/CordialMinuet/ci/default/tree/server/


There is a $3000 bounty waiting for the FIRST person who accomplishes any ONE
of the following six hacking challenges, submitted to me by email at
(jasonrohrer [AT] fastmail [DOT] fm) along with a complete explanation of how
the hack was accomplished.  Note that only remote methods (including remote
social engineering) qualify.  Physically breaking into the server location will
disqualify you.  Completing more than one challenge will not earn you more than
one bounty (though it may get your hired by me as a consultant).

transaction) into the database table (dollar_balance column) for the following

Challenge 5:
