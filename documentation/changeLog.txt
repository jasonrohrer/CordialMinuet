Version 10     ??

--Fixed stale list of other games when returning to waiting for opponent.

--Changed row coloring of our row to make our possible squares from their
  perspective more visible.  Changed reveal black-stroking to ensure that
  all squares in row that they gave to themselves are visible at the end
  of the game.

--Changed FOLD key command to f instead of x (thanks Zed).

--Added left/right arrow keys for picking reveal column (thanks Zed).




Version 9      Live Server Fixes

--Added detailed logging around ending games to catch DENIED bug during
  wait_move.




Version 9      2014-November-27

--Fixed client bug in coin distribution after a tie.

--Fixed confusing behavior when opponent bets less than us and then folds (our
  larger bet is now shown moving into the pot before the payout---before, our
  larger bet was not shown moving into the pot).

--Fixed bugs in possible score graph update when sliders are dragged over
  blocked columns or when one slider pushes another out of the way.

--Fixed bug when opponent leaves game right before start of next round (board
  would fade back in and redraw all color strokes from the last round).

--Fixed post-game report to show pre-buy-in balance and buy-in.

--Typed credit card info is now replaced with 0 characters in recordedGame
  file.

--Fixed bugs in game button placement on game list page.

--Added support for setting min and max allowed game stakes on server and
  through protocol in client.  This could be useful for tournaments and other
  contests.

--Rewrote the possible score calculation in a way that avoids redundant work by
  calculating scores for each player separately instead of exploring the full
  game tree.  This results in a 25x speedup for the calculation when placing
  the first slider (visiting 24,000 leaves instead of 604,800 leaves), meaning
  that the calculation can now be done in realtime while smooth dragging 
  (thanks Ralph V).

--List of three closest-valued other games now shown on the Waiting For
  Opponent screen.

--Changed to use a number picker to enter code for in-person kiosk mode instead
  of a text field (so that kiosk can work without a keyboard).

--Fixed so that clear button doesn't linger for one frame upon returing to
  deposit page after clearing account details.

--Added an [@] button to the deposit page to help international keyboards.

--Confirmation for leaving game.

--Added keyboard mode for playing game (thanks Zed).

--Fixed server bug where bet DENIED if opponent has left (thanks Matt W).

--Improved client behavior in middle of a game when games force-ended by admin.

--Server now denies clients that are waiting for games to start when games have
  been force-ended by admin.

--Fixed server so that shutdownMode allows current game rounds to finish.

--Improved behavior when picking sliders that overlap at edge of grid (thanks
  Ralph V).

--Added possible score hints when mousing over possible square for opponent or
  self.  Lock onto square by clicking it to allow mousing over the locked
  possible score graph (thanks Ralph V).

--Removed server log message when waiting on a semaphore.





Version 8      Live Server Fixes

--Added a tribute cap, initially at 4 coins.

--Adjusted tribute percentage to 17, and lowered cap to 1.  Thus, at most one
  coin is taken as tribute, but it is taken from all pots that are 6 or larger.

--Fixed so that stale games are ended before fetching balance on menu screen
  (for example, after force-quit or crash during a game).






Version 8      2014-November-20
