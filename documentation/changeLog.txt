Version 12     Live Server Fixes

--Fixed precision bug in computing house balance change after tournament
  prizes are paid.

--Changed so that the buy-in for a tournament match isn't counted against your
  profit stat until the match ends (matches that go over deadline simply don't
  count instead of counting as a profit loss for both players).

--Fixed a bug in pairwise tournament feeding blocking so that it only blocks
  based on current tournament pairwise profits.

--Fixed prize calculations to handle settings where every player gets a prize.

--Added entry fee and prize pool display to tournament prize list.

--Fixed active users graph to filter out duplicates.

--Fixed tournament so that tied players split the total prize sum at their
  prize levels (thanks Josh C).

--Fixed tournament stats to not uptick game count for a player until game is
  over (so you can't reload leaderboard and look for the uptick to figure out
  who you just joined a game with) (thanks Benjamin Y).

--Added Next and Previous links to scroll through full leaderboards.

--Fixed to retry random name picking 10 times when creating a new account
  (there are only 443,556 possible names, so duplicate names will be necessary
  at some point, but avoid them as much as possible).



Version 12     2015-January-8

--Fixed decimal precision formatting glitch on post-game result screen when
  starting balance has only two decimals.

--Fixed possible freeze when dragging pickers (thanks Benjamin Y).

--Fixed column pickers bouncing back and forth at low target framerates
  (thanks Zed).

--Fixed crash when halfFrameRate would push frame rate to 0.

--Added settings for controlling watercolor stroke darkness to accommodate
  various monitor brightnesses (specifically for PAX booth monitors).

--Added display of recomputed house balance in admin UI.

--Fixed server to correct for reset of auto_increment game_id values after
  a MySQL restart.  Now game_ids are guaranteed unique.

--Added support for setting antes greater than 1 on server.

--Added server stats for tracking rounds, folds, one-ante folds, and reveals.





Version 11     Live Server Fixes

--Setting for a house table rake (coins taken from each player at the start of
  a table).  To support tournament mode.

--Support for time limited, single-stake tournament embedded in main game.

--Improved formulas used on leaderboards.

--Added Elo ratings.

--Fixed leaderboards to hide effects of live games (so you can't check who
  you're playing against by watching changes in leaderboard numbers).

--Improved security by passing Yubikey through a regexp and not logging failed
  admin passwords (thanks Cayce U).

--Fixed to pass user-submitted credit card data through a regexp to prevent
  exec injection attacks.  Card data was validated as being properly encrypted,
  but after decryption, it was trusted blindly (thanks Cayce U).

--Logs are now flushed after 30 days to save database space.

--Added an Elo rating floor of 1, and moved starting point to 1.




Version 11     2014-December-16

--Fixed so that you can't click on an opponent's possible square after the game
  board starts fading out post-opponent-fold.  Before, the locked square
  arrows would linger after the fade (thanks Nathan C).

--You can now mouse over your own won squares, after all your squares are set
  but pre-reveal, to preview how revealing a given square will affect the score
  graph (thanks MZO).

--Changed behavior post-disconnect when the game has timed out out from
  underneath a player (now displays a GAME TIMED OUT message instead of
  DENIED BY SERVER).

--Changed score graph to hold off on updating when opponent's move is received
  until after some of the board ink is applied to preserve the anticipation
  (thanks iisjreg).

--Fixed major bug in Elo calculation (thanks ..)





Version 10     Live Server Fixes

--Even more detailed game logging to catch DENIED bug during wait_move.

--Fixed other game list on waiting screen to ignore games that are ending due
  to players leaving.

--Finally found and fixed the DENIED BY SERVER bug during wait_move.  Server
  is now more robust when dealing with unexpected player request orderings.

--Added a grace period to server-side enforcement of move time limit to allow
  for one client retry during a network outage.

--Added number at the top of each bar on users graphs.




Version 10     2014-December-2

--Fixed stale list of other games when returning to waiting for opponent.

--Changed row coloring of our row to make our possible squares from their
  perspective more visible.  Changed reveal black-stroking to ensure that
  all squares in row that they gave to themselves are visible at the end
  of the game.

--Changed FOLD key command to f instead of x (thanks Zed).

--Added left/right arrow keys for picking reveal column (thanks Zed).





Version 9      Live Server Fixes

--Added detailed logging around ending games to catch DENIED bug during
  wait_move.





Version 9      2014-November-27

--Fixed client bug in coin distribution after a tie.

--Fixed confusing behavior when opponent bets less than us and then folds (our
  larger bet is now shown moving into the pot before the payout---before, our
  larger bet was not shown moving into the pot).

--Fixed bugs in possible score graph update when sliders are dragged over
  blocked columns or when one slider pushes another out of the way.

--Fixed bug when opponent leaves game right before start of next round (board
  would fade back in and redraw all color strokes from the last round).

--Fixed post-game report to show pre-buy-in balance and buy-in.

--Typed credit card info is now replaced with 0 characters in recordedGame
  file.

--Fixed bugs in game button placement on game list page.

--Added support for setting min and max allowed game stakes on server and
  through protocol in client.  This could be useful for tournaments and other
  contests.

--Rewrote the possible score calculation in a way that avoids redundant work by
  calculating scores for each player separately instead of exploring the full
  game tree.  This results in a 25x speedup for the calculation when placing
  the first slider (visiting 24,000 leaves instead of 604,800 leaves), meaning
  that the calculation can now be done in realtime while smooth dragging 
  (thanks Ralph V).

--List of three closest-valued other games now shown on the Waiting For
  Opponent screen.

--Changed to use a number picker to enter code for in-person kiosk mode instead
  of a text field (so that kiosk can work without a keyboard).

--Fixed so that clear button doesn't linger for one frame upon returing to
  deposit page after clearing account details.

--Added an [@] button to the deposit page to help international keyboards.

--Confirmation for leaving game.

--Added keyboard mode for playing game (thanks Zed).

--Fixed server bug where bet DENIED if opponent has left (thanks Matt W).

--Improved client behavior in middle of a game when games force-ended by admin.

--Server now denies clients that are waiting for games to start when games have
  been force-ended by admin.

--Fixed server so that shutdownMode allows current game rounds to finish.

--Improved behavior when picking sliders that overlap at edge of grid (thanks
  Ralph V).

--Added possible score hints when mousing over possible square for opponent or
  self.  Lock onto square by clicking it to allow mousing over the locked
  possible score graph (thanks Ralph V).

--Removed server log message when waiting on a semaphore.





Version 8      Live Server Fixes

--Added a tribute cap, initially at 4 coins.

--Adjusted tribute percentage to 17, and lowered cap to 1.  Thus, at most one
  coin is taken as tribute, but it is taken from all pots that are 6 or larger.

--Fixed so that stale games are ended before fetching balance on menu screen
  (for example, after force-quit or crash during a game).






Version 8      2014-November-20

First private alpha release.
