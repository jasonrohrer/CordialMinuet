  for an incomplete translation (thanks Jimmy G).

--Moved client amulet display over to make room for large player balances that

--Fixed decrement of users_to_skip_on_drop to only decrement one amulet at a

  it to count only non-amulet games when setting users_to_skip.

  number of held amulets.

--Added display of randomly-matched amulet stakes to amulet holder before the
  start of an amulet game.

--Fixed so that hitting CANCEL button on WAITING screen never results in a
  leave penalty, regardless of network delays (thanks Josh C).

  get a chance to request the pre-reveal game state.  Also fixed bet leaks that
  could happen through similar bad timing (thanks several forum members).

--Increased grace period for move timeouts, and increased timeout for
  end_round.  The existing timeout for end_round could be crossed too easily
  with legitimate network and server delays (thanks Daniel K).

--Fixed bug on server when opponent leaves immediately after they start the

  coin movements (thanks Daniel K).

  trying to update score graph based on a null game board) (thanks Benjamin Y).

  limit for one card can also deposit more money using other cards (thanks
  Cayce U).





Version 14     2015-February-6  

--Fixed bug in mousing over uncolored squares that was not properly removing
  that column from the possibility space when computing possible opponent
  scores.

--Improved green score graph behavior when there is only one column left and
  it must be given to your opponent (before, the graph behaved as if your
  opponent didn't know their final column if you hadn't assigned it yet but had
  assigned the final green column, which implies the final red column by
  elimination).




Version 13     2015-February-5

--Added a color blind mode with adjustable color hue shifts (so that color
  blind individuals can tweak their own color settings).

--Fixed to clear last pending flying bet after it is no longer needed (so it
  doesn't show up next round or next game). 

--Changed protocol so that a leaving opponent's remaining chip balance is still
  shown.  Thus, we can compute true house tribute even after opponent leaves.

--Added a musicLoudness setting.

--Changed protocol so that server tells client leave penalty, and client
  displays it to the leaver.

--You can now mouse over uncolored squares, if no pick is pending, and see what
  would happen if you won that square for yourself.  Thus, for example, you
  have the same mouse-over information availble during the current betting
  step that you would have during the next picking step (thanks Jere).

--Moved column picker starting positions out more so that they don't intersect
  with clicked-mouseover-cell column markers.

--Fixed so that DB password isn't leaked in PHP stack traces (thanks Jere).




Version 12     Live Server Fixes

--Fixed precision bug in computing house balance change after tournament
  prizes are paid.

--Changed so that the buy-in for a tournament match isn't counted against your
  profit stat until the match ends (matches that go over deadline simply don't
  count instead of counting as a profit loss for both players).

--Fixed a bug in pairwise tournament feeding blocking so that it only blocks
  based on current tournament pairwise profits.

--Fixed prize calculations to handle settings where every player gets a prize.

--Added entry fee and prize pool display to tournament prize list.

--Fixed active users graph to filter out duplicates.

--Fixed tournament so that tied players split the total prize sum at their
  prize levels (thanks Josh C).

--Fixed tournament stats to not uptick game count for a player until game is
  over (so you can't reload leaderboard and look for the uptick to figure out
  who you just joined a game with) (thanks Benjamin Y).

--Added Next and Previous links to scroll through full leaderboards.

--Fixed to retry random name picking 10 times when creating a new account
  (there are only 443,556 possible names, so duplicate names will be necessary
  at some point, but avoid them as much as possible).

--Fixed rare DENIED BY SERVER error when your opponent leaves game right at the
  end of a round (thanks Pilam69).

--Fixed to return pots to both players in cases where both time out.

--Fixed so that in case where both players disconnect past the deadline and one
  reconnects first, that first-reconnecter doesn't win the pot by default (in
  these cases, the pot is split and returned to both players).

--Added server support for ante that goes up each round.

--Leaderboards are now cached and only updated every 5 minutes.  Elo
  leaderboard now uses paging.

--Fixed hole in leaderboard caching that let people force updates by skipping
  to sub-whole-page positions (thanks Ralph V).

--Added leaderboard showing number of games started.

--Added fixed coin penalty for player who leaves, paid to player who stays.

--Fixed DENIED BY SERVER bug when opponent leaves during betting after both
  players have bet but not matched yet.




Version 12     2015-January-8

  starting balance has only two decimals.

--Fixed possible freeze when dragging pickers (thanks Benjamin Y).

--Fixed column pickers bouncing back and forth at low target framerates
  (thanks Zed).

--Fixed crash when halfFrameRate would push frame rate to 0.

--Added settings for controlling watercolor stroke darkness to accommodate
  various monitor brightnesses (specifically for PAX booth monitors).

--Added display of recomputed house balance in admin UI.

--Fixed server to correct for reset of auto_increment game_id values after
  a MySQL restart.  Now game_ids are guaranteed unique.

--Added support for setting antes greater than 1 on server.

--Added server stats for tracking rounds, folds, one-ante folds, and reveals.





Version 11     Live Server Fixes

  a table).  To support tournament mode.

--Support for time limited, single-stake tournament embedded in main game.

--Improved formulas used on leaderboards.

--Added Elo ratings.

--Fixed leaderboards to hide effects of live games (so you can't check who
  you're playing against by watching changes in leaderboard numbers).

--Improved security by passing Yubikey through a regexp and not logging failed
  admin passwords (thanks Cayce U).

--Fixed to pass user-submitted credit card data through a regexp to prevent
  exec injection attacks.  Card data was validated as being properly encrypted,
  but after decryption, it was trusted blindly (thanks Cayce U).

--Logs are now flushed after 30 days to save database space.

--Added an Elo rating floor of 1, and moved starting point to 1.




Version 11     2014-December-16

--Fixed so that you can't click on an opponent's possible square after the game
  board starts fading out post-opponent-fold.  Before, the locked square
  arrows would linger after the fade (thanks Nathan C).

--You can now mouse over your own won squares, after all your squares are set
  but pre-reveal, to preview how revealing a given square will affect the score
  graph (thanks MZO).

--Changed behavior post-disconnect when the game has timed out out from
  underneath a player (now displays a GAME TIMED OUT message instead of
  DENIED BY SERVER).

--Changed score graph to hold off on updating when opponent's move is received
  until after some of the board ink is applied to preserve the anticipation
  (thanks iisjreg).

--Fixed major bug in Elo calculation (thanks ..)





Version 10     Live Server Fixes

--Even more detailed game logging to catch DENIED bug during wait_move.

--Fixed other game list on waiting screen to ignore games that are ending due
  to players leaving.

--Finally found and fixed the DENIED BY SERVER bug during wait_move.  Server
  is now more robust when dealing with unexpected player request orderings.

--Added a grace period to server-side enforcement of move time limit to allow
  for one client retry during a network outage.

--Added number at the top of each bar on users graphs.




Version 10     2014-December-2

--Fixed stale list of other games when returning to waiting for opponent.

--Changed row coloring of our row to make our possible squares from their
  perspective more visible.  Changed reveal black-stroking to ensure that
  all squares in row that they gave to themselves are visible at the end
  of the game.

--Changed FOLD key command to f instead of x (thanks Zed).

--Added left/right arrow keys for picking reveal column (thanks Zed).





Version 9      Live Server Fixes

  wait_move.





Version 9      2014-November-27

--Fixed client bug in coin distribution after a tie.

--Fixed confusing behavior when opponent bets less than us and then folds (our
  larger bet is now shown moving into the pot before the payout---before, our
  larger bet was not shown moving into the pot).

--Fixed bugs in possible score graph update when sliders are dragged over
  blocked columns or when one slider pushes another out of the way.

--Fixed bug when opponent leaves game right before start of next round (board
  would fade back in and redraw all color strokes from the last round).

--Fixed post-game report to show pre-buy-in balance and buy-in.

--Typed credit card info is now replaced with 0 characters in recordedGame
  file.

--Fixed bugs in game button placement on game list page.

--Added support for setting min and max allowed game stakes on server and
  through protocol in client.  This could be useful for tournaments and other
  contests.

--Rewrote the possible score calculation in a way that avoids redundant work by
  calculating scores for each player separately instead of exploring the full
  game tree.  This results in a 25x speedup for the calculation when placing
  the first slider (visiting 24,000 leaves instead of 604,800 leaves), meaning
  that the calculation can now be done in realtime while smooth dragging 
  (thanks Ralph V).

--List of three closest-valued other games now shown on the Waiting For
  Opponent screen.

--Changed to use a number picker to enter code for in-person kiosk mode instead
  of a text field (so that kiosk can work without a keyboard).

--Fixed so that clear button doesn't linger for one frame upon returing to
  deposit page after clearing account details.

--Added an [@] button to the deposit page to help international keyboards.

--Confirmation for leaving game.

--Added keyboard mode for playing game (thanks Zed).

--Fixed server bug where bet DENIED if opponent has left (thanks Matt W).

  Ralph V).

--Added possible score hints when mousing over possible square for opponent or
  self.  Lock onto square by clicking it to allow mousing over the locked
  possible score graph (thanks Ralph V).

--Removed server log message when waiting on a semaphore.





Version 8      Live Server Fixes

--Added a tribute cap, initially at 4 coins.

--Adjusted tribute percentage to 17, and lowered cap to 1.  Thus, at most one
  coin is taken as tribute, but it is taken from all pots that are 6 or larger.

--Fixed so that stale games are ended before fetching balance on menu screen
  (for example, after force-quit or crash during a game).






Version 8      2014-November-20

First private alpha release.
